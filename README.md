# LeetCode-Solutions
Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions Repository**! 🧠✨

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems.

Each solution includes:
- ✅ Clean and efficient code implementation in C++, MySQL
- 🧩 Clear explanation of the approach
- ⏱️ Time and space complexity analysis

## 📁 Repository Structure
The repository is organised by problem based on their numeric ID, which makes it easy to navigate and find specific solutions.
